# License-Plate-Recognition-System
Developed a system for detecting and recognizing license plates from vehicle images. Implemented OpenCV to handle grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and edge detection for license plate detection. Used contour detection and masking to isolate license plate regions. Integrated EasyOCR to recognize and extract text from the plates, displaying results with bounding boxes on the images
